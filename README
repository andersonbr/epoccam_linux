-------------
C program to communicate with Kinoni's EpocCam mobile application
Copyright (c) 2014, Oliver Giles

EpocCam is produced by Kinoni (http://www.kinoni.com), who generously
provided useful documentation and support for this project.

Using EpocCam, you can use your mobile phone as a wireless webcam.
This application provides a linux compatibility wrapper.

Status
------
epoccam_linux has no compile-time dependencies and should build on
all flavours of linux.

This project may be developed further for end-user ease of use.

Running
-------
In order to emulate a webcam driver that will be recognised by even
closed-source software such as Skype, you should install v4l2loopback.

v4l2loopback is available at https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback,
as well as in the Ubuntu Universe Repository and in the Arch User
Repository.

Launching
$ sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
will create a device node /dev/videoX, where X is the next free number.

As epoccam_linux simply extracts a video stream from the network, use
an application such as ffmpeg to decode its output and write to the
loopback device:
$ epoccam_linux 0 | ffmpeg -vcodec h264 -i - -f v4l2 /dev/video0

You can test the functionality with
$ mplayer tv://

Next steps
----------
Implement audio streaming
Interactive control (GTK tray icon?)
